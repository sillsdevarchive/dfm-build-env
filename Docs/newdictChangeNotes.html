    <h2>Setting up a new dictionary - important change notes in past
        releases</h2>

    <blockquote>
    <p>With DictonaryGeneration 3.5.0, the text between {{ and }} is
        ignored for building the index. See section
        <a href="newdict.html#IndexFileSizeReduction">Reducing the size of the
        generated index files</a>. If this behavour is not desired, set the
        property dictionaryGenerationOmitParFromIndex to false. The class
        DictionaryUpdatePartialIndex is obsolete starting with 3.5.0 (still
        included for compatibility reasons, but without any function).</p>

    <p>With DictonaryGeneration 3.0.0 the Normation classes are now
        located in the package
        de.kugihan.dictionaryformids.translation.normation. DictionaryUpdate
        classes are now located in the package
        de.kugihan.dictionaryformids.dictgen.dictionaryupdate. For existing
        DictionaryForMIDs.properties files, the properties NormationClassName
        and DictionaryUpdateClassName do not need to be updated, because
        DictionaryForMIDs automatically maps the old package names to the new
        package names.</p>

    <p>With DictionaryGeneration 2.7.0 the 'pre-normate'-call which did remove
        punctuation characters was removed; normation now relies completely on
        the normation class. Starting with 2.7.0 the normation classes can use
        the method Util.removePunctuation to remove punctuation characters (with
        DictionaryGeneration &lt; 2.7.0 this was done automatically); or just call
        NormationLib.defaultNormation as the first step in normation.</p>

    <p>With DictionaryForMIDs 2.5.0 /
    DictionaryGeneration 2.5.0: The structure of the index file was extended with the
    searchindicator (see <a href="newdictDictionaryGeneration.html#SetupGenerationFiles">Files
    generated by the DictionaryGeneration tool</a>). For this reason the
    dictionaries have to be re-generated with DictionaryGeneration 2.5.0.<br>
    Also, with DictionaryGeneration 2.5.0 a change for the DictionaryUpdate class
    was introduced: the method removeDisturbingWords was renamed to the method
    updateKeyWordVector; now the keywords in the vector are accessed with <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    ((IndexKeyWordEntry) keyWordVector.elementAt(elementCount)).keyWord</p>
