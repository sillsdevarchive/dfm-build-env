    <h2>Normation: Implementing language specific features</h2>
    <h3><br>
        General</h3>
    <p>With normation you can implement phonetic searches for a language and
        a lot more. Normation classes for several languages
        <a href="newdictNormationLang.html">are already implemented</a>. The
        description below gives you information for implementing an additional
        Normation class. </p>
    <p>For normation a Java class needs to be implemented. The name
        of this Java class is provided in the property languageXNormationClassName.</p>
    <p>The class name needs to include the package identification (no package
    identification if default package is used).</p>
    <p>Per convention the Normation classes have as name NormationXXX where XXX is
    the value from the property languageXFilePostfix.</p>
    <p>The normation class needs to inherit from the class
        de.kugihan.dictionaryformids.normation.Normation and provide a language
        specific implementation for the methods of the Normation class. Here is
        an extract from the Normation class:</p>
    <pre>package de.kugihan.dictionaryformids.translation.normation;

  public class Normation {
    public StringBuffer normateWord(StringBuffer nonNormatedWord) {
      // default is to do nothing
      return nonNormatedWord;
    }

    public Vector searchWord(String text) {
      // default is to do return only the provided text
      Vector words = new Vector();
      words.addElement(new SearchedWord(text));
      return words;
    }

    public Vector suggestionWord(String text) {
      // default is to do return no suggestion
      Vector suggestions = new Vector();
      return suggestions;
    }
  }
</pre>
    <p>Writing Normation-classes is an easy task for the Java part. If you know some
    rules for a language but you do not know how to implement in Java or you do not
    have an Java development environment,
    <a href="http://dictionarymid.sourceforge.net/contact.html">send us</a> the rules and
        we will implement them.</p>

    <p>In any case, if you did implement a Normation class, please
        <a href="http://dictionarymid.sourceforge.net/contact.html">send it to us</a>,
        so that we can make it available for other people who set up a dictionary.</p>

    <h3>Implementation of method normatedWord</h3>

    <p>Overwrite the method normateWord for support of phonetic search. Or
        for search of words that have different spellings. This method takes a
        nonNormatedWord and returns a normed representation of that word.</p>

    <p>Example: NormationGer parses the nonNormatedWord for the German
        'Umlauts' (ä, ö, ü) and returns the word with the Umlaut-paraphrasing
        (ae, oe, ue). So the user can search for &quot;Mädchen&quot; or &quot;Maedchen&quot;
        and the translation will be found in both cases.</p>

    <p>Note: in general you should also call NormationLib.defaultNormation
        as part of normatedWord. <font size="2">NormationLib.defaultNormation</font>
        provides some general useful normations such as ignoring upper case/lower case
        and ignoring punctuation characters.</p>

    <h3>Implementation of method searchWord</h3>

    <p>With searchWord you can generate additional words that are searched.
        searchWord returns a Vector of SearchedWord.</p>

        <p>Example: NormationJpn generates a Hiragana and Katakana
        representation from a romaji input word. When the user enters a word in
    romaji, the search done for both Hiragana and Katakana.</p>

    <h3>Implementation of method suggestionWord</h3>

    <p>With suggestionWord you can generate additional words that are
        suggested to the user when no match is found. The user then can pick a
        suggestion and re-run the translation. suggestionWord returns a Vector
        of SuggestedWord.</p>
