    <h2>DictionaryUpdate classes</h2>

    <p>DictionaryGeneration customization is done by providing a
    &quot;DictionaryUpdate&quot;-class with a specific behaviour. A customized
    &quot;DictionaryUpdate&quot;-class can be provided for each language. This is done via the
    property languageXDictionaryUpdateClassName of DictionaryForMIDs.properties, see
    section <a href="newdictProperties.html">Configuring the properties of the file
    DictionaryForMIDs.properties</a>.</p>
    <p>You need to have a Java SDK installed on your PC for implementing
        DictionaryUpdate classes and you should have some basic Java knowledge.</p>
    <p>The DictionaryUpdate class provides the following methods:</p>
    <pre>package de.kugihan.dictionaryformids.dictgen.dictionaryupdate;
    public class DictionaryUpdate {

      public String updateDictionaryExpression(String dictionaryExpression) {
        // default is to do nothing
        return dictionaryExpression;
      }

      public String removeNonSearchParts(String expression) {
        // default is to do nothing
        return expression;
      }

      public void updateKeyWordVector(Vector keyWordVector) {
        // default is to do nothing
      }
    }
    </pre>
    <p>First on the term 'expression': DictionaryGeneration reads strings
        from inputdictionaryfile till the separation character (or newline) is
        found. These strings are called expressions. An expression may contain
        one or more words, depending on your inputdictionaryfile. An expression
        could be for example &quot;give up&quot;, then &quot;give&quot; would be a word and &quot;up&quot;
        would be a word of the expression. The words are put into the index
        files.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <pre>updateDictionaryExpression</pre>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For each expression that is read for a language this method is called. This
    methods gets passed the expression that was read from the inputdictionaryfile
    (parameter dictionaryExpression) and returns the expression that goes into the
    generated dictionary. In the method updateDictionaryExpression you may do
    whatever conversion from the input expression to the generated expression.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <pre>removeNonSearchParts</pre>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>An expression may contain some information that is useful for showing in the
    translation result, but is not useful for being included in the search indexes.
    For example, expressions from the inputdictionaryfile may be of the form &quot;word
    [pronounciation]&quot;. The pronounciation may look cryptic and may not be useful for
    searching. Then the part in square brackets should be removed by the method
    removeNonSearchParts. Still the pronounciation will be shown by
    DictionaryForMIDs in the translation result. <br>
    The method removeNonSearchParts is called after the method
    updateDictionaryExpression.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <pre>updateKeyWordVector</pre>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>For some dictionaries it turns out that there are words in the
    inputdictionaryfile that simply should be ignored. After DictionryGeneration did
    split up the expressions into its words this method is called. keyWordVector
    contains the list of&nbsp; IndexKeyWordEntry objects:</p>
    <pre>public class IndexKeyWordEntry {
      public String keyWord; // the word for the index
      public SearchIndicator searchIndicator;  // typically not needed
    ...
    }</pre>
    <p>In the method updateKeyWordVector those words that should not go in the
    dictionary can be removed from keyWordVector. <br>
    The method updateKeyWordVector is called after the method removeNonSearchParts.</p>
