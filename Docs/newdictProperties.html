    <h2><a name="SetupJADProperties"></a>Configuring the properties of
    the file DictionaryForMIDs.properties</h2>
    <p>DictionaryForMIDs is customized via properties in
    DictionaryForMIDs.properties. Each of the properties must be provided
    unless noted otherwise.</p>
    <p>Here is the list of properties:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>infoText</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Text that is shown on the top of the info-dialog. Please provide here
    information about the dictionary. Obligatory, include here contact
    information for someone who can be contacted concerning the dictionary.
    That may be you (the person who set up this dictionary into
    DictionaryForMIDs) and/or the maintainer of the dictionary itself.
    Please include an email-address and/or homepage.<br>
    Also obligatory, please put a copyright notice for the dictionary.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>dictionaryAbbreviation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Short abbreviation for identifying the origin of the dictionary. This
    is an abbreviation for the name of the organization or project where the
    dictionary comes from, e.g. freedict for the dictionaries from
    freedict.org. Preferably only a few characters long. The JarCreator tool
    uses this property to form the application name.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>numberOfAvailableLanguages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Defines how many languages are in the dictionary. For many
    dictionaries this will be 2. For each language the languageX-properties
    need to be defined as described below (X is a number starting from 1 to
    numberOfAvailableLanguages).<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>languageXDisplayText</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Text that is used on the user interface to identify the language. X
    needs to be replaced with the number of the column for the language. For
    example:<br>
    language1DisplayText: English<br>
    language2DisplayText: Portuguese<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>languageXFilePostfix</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Text that is used in file names to identify searchfile and index
    files for a language. Typically a 3-letter text, such as Eng for
    English; as defined in the ISO 3-letter codes available
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes">here</a>.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>languageXIsSearchable</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A boolean property with either the value true or the value false. Set
    to true when it is allowed to search for translations for that language.
    Normally this property is set to true for bi-directional translation
    dictionaries. For lookup dictionaries, e.g. for an acronym dictionary,
    where it is only possibly to search from the acronym to the explanation,
    this value is set false for the explanation language/column. For an
    example see the elements dictionary from
    <a href="http://dictionarymid.sourceforge.net/dict.html">the download section</a>.</p>

    <p>Also for an unidirectional dictionary, which for example only translates
    English to Portuguese (but not Portuguese to English), you have to set
    languageXIsSearchable to false for Portuguese.<br>
    This property is optional, the default value is true.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>languageXGenerateIndex</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A boolean property with either the value true or the value false.
    Tells DictionayGeneration whether to generate an index for this
    language.<br>
    This property is optional, the default value is true.<br>
    Normally this property has the same value as languageXIsSearchable.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>languageXHasSeparateDictionaryFile</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A boolean property with either the value true or the value false. Set
    to true, when there is a separate dictionaryXXX.csv file for this
    language (for an explanation about the files, see section
    <a href="newdictDictionaryGeneration.html">
    Files generated by the DictionaryGeneration tool</a>). Normally all
    languages use the same dictionaryXXX.csv files, namely for those
    dictionaries where expression ABC translates to XYZ and this means that
    XYZ translates back to ABC. For dictionaries where ABC translates to
    XYZ, however XYZ translates to DEF, this property is set to true. For an
    example, see the German-French freedict dictionary from
    <a href="http://dictionarymid.sourceforge.net/dict.html">
    the download section</a>.<br>
    For documentation, see <a href="newdictMultiple.html">here.</a><br>
    This property is optional, the default value is false.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>dictionaryGenerationSeparatorCharacter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Separation character for the input dictionary file that is read by
    DictionayGeneration. This character needs to be put in apostrophes, e.g.
    ','. Can also be '\t' (backslash plus t) for a tab-character.<br>
    This property is optional, the default value is \t (tab-character)<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    indexFileSeparationCharacter/searchListFileSeparationCharacter/dictionaryFileSeparationCharacter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Separation character for the output csv files that are generated by
    DictionayGeneration. This character needs to be put in apostrophes, e.g.
    ','. Can also be '\t' (backslash plus t) for a tab-character. Typically
    these properties are set to the same value as
    dictionaryGenerationSeparatorCharacter.<br>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>dictionaryGenerationLanguageXExpressionSplitString</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Used by DictionaryGeneration: when for a language a read expression
    actually contains several expressions, then this property is set to the
    string that separates the expressions. <br>
    Example: the expression &quot;to choose, to select, to pick&quot; contains not one
    but three expressions: (1) &quot;to choose&quot;, (2) &quot;to select&quot; and (3) &quot;to
    pick&quot;. By setting dictionaryGenerationLanguageXExpressionSplitString to
    ,&nbsp; for this language, DictionaryGeneration will extract these 3
    expressions. This is done for language2 with the following line:<br>
    dictionaryGenerationLanguage2ExpressionSplitString=,<br>
    This property is optional, the default value is 'property not set'.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>dictionaryGenerationInputCharEncoding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Character set encoding for the input dictionary file that is read by
    DictionaryGeneration.</p>
    <p>Supported character set encodings are:<br>
    UTF-8<br>
    ISO-8859-1<br>
    US-ASCII</p>
    <p>This property is optional, the default value is ISO-8859-1.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>indexCharEncoding/searchListCharEncoding/dictionaryCharEncoding</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These 3 properties define the character set encoding that is used for
    the output searchlist file/index files/dictionary files.</p>
    <p>Supported character set encodings are:<br>
    UTF-8<br>
    ISO-8859-1<br>
    US-ASCII</p>
    <p>Note: on very old mobiles/PDA devices UTF-8 may not yet be supported.
    We would expect that each model that was released recently supports
    UTF-8.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>languageXDictionaryUpdateClassName</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This property defines for the DictionaryGeneration-tool a &quot;DictionaryUpdate&quot;-class
    that is used for a language. DictionaryUpdateClass changes the ways
    entries are stored when the tool converts an input dictionary file into
    the DictionaryforMIDs generated files. For details on the files created
    when a dictionary is generated, see <a href="newdictDictionaryGeneration.html">
    Generating the files for DictionaryForMIDs</a>.</p>

    <p>For example: DictionaryUpdateEngDef removes unneeded words from the
    indexes such as &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;at&quot;. These words are unneeded in the
    indexes and adds unnecessarily to the file size. When a user performs a
    search then these words will still be displayed in the definition,
    however.</p>

    <p>The property languageXDictionaryUpdateClassName is optional. Use this
    property only if you really need it, otherwise remove any
    languageXDictionaryUpdateClassName-lines in the property file !<br>
    &nbsp;</p>

    <ul>
    <li><a name="Normation"></a>languageXNormationClassName</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is the name of a Java class that is used to 'normate' words.
    Whereas DictionaryUpdateClass changes dictionary files only when the
    dictionary is generated, NormationClass affects the words that the user
    enters when searching.</p>

    <p>For example: NormationGer parses the nonNormatedWord for the German
    'Umlauts' (ä, ö, ü) and returns the word with the Umlaut-paraphrasing (ae,
    oe, ue). So the user can search for &quot;Mädchen&quot; or &quot;Maedchen&quot; and the
    translation will be found in both cases.</p>

    <p>These changes in the dictionary files are done in 2 steps.&nbsp;
    First the DictionaryGeneration-tool calls the NormationClass to change
    the indexes to incorporate the phonetic changes (ä is changed to ae, for
    example).&nbsp; Then when the user searches, the NormationClass is
    called again to make the phonetic changes to match the changes that were
    made earlier with the DictionaryGeneration-tool.</p>

    <p>Via Normation-classes it is possible to provide language-specific
    search features and phonetic search. A lot of power lies in these
    Normation classes !!<br>
    Normation classes are available for several languages. For a list of
        available Normation classes see <a href="newdictNormationLang.html">here</a>.
        <br>
        If you intend to implement a new Normation classe, see the documentation
        of NormationClass<a href="newdictNormation.html">
    here.</a><br>
        The property languageXNormationClassName is optional.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>languageXContentNN properties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the languageXContentNN properties you can specify the content of
    your dictionary. For example you can specify that there is a
    pronunciation part, an explanation part, etc.<br>
    For more information on the languageXContentNN-properties, see <a href="newdictContent.html">
        here</a>.<br>
        The languageXContentNN properties are optional.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>searchListFileMaxSize/indexFileMaxSize/dictionaryFileMaxSize</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Defines the size in bytes of the biggest searchlist file/index
    file/dictionary file, as generated by DictionaryGeneration. These
    properties are automatically determined and set by DictionaryGeneration,
    normally there is no longer a need to set these properties manually.<br>
    However these properties need to be manually defined when a dictionary
    is merged from two (or more) different source dictionaries and
    DictionaryGeneration is run once for each of these source dictionary
    (the values from the first run would be overwritten by the second run).&nbsp;
    When these properties are already manually set when DictionaryGeneration
    is run, then no automatic generation for these properties is done. For
    the manual values you must ensure that no searchlist file/index
    file/dictionary file is bigger than the property value, otherwise some
    translations are not found. There is no problem if the value of these
    properties is bigger than the actual maximum file size. For example if
    you set the dictionaryFileMaxSize to 50000 even if the biggest
    dictionary file is only 35000 bytes everything will work correctly.
    However DictionaryForMIDs will allocate 50000 bytes of heap memory, and
    keep in mind that specifically for older devices heap memory is scarce.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    dictionaryGenerationMinNumberOfEntriesPerDictionaryFile/dictionaryGenerationMinNumberOfEntriesPerIndexFile</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Defines for DictionaryGeneration the number of entries (= lines) per
    dictionary file and per index file.<br>
    These properties are optional, the default value for
    dictionaryGenerationMinNumberOfEntriesPerDictionaryFile is 200 and the
    default value for dictionaryGenerationMinNumberOfEntriesPerIndexFile is
    500.<br>
        As a general hint, you could try to set these values so that the size of
    a single directory file and the size of a single index file do not
    exceed 100 kB (size defined by properties
    searchListFileMaxSize/indexFileMaxSize/dictionaryFileMaxSize).<br>
    If you set up a small dictionary that should support very old devices
    with very little heap memory, then set these values low enough, for
    example so that the biggest file does not exceed 10 kB.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>dictionaryGenerationOmitParFromIndex</li>
    </ul>
    <p>DictionaryGeneration does exclude text within {{ and }} from indexing
        (i.e. the text within {{ and }} is not included in the index, see
        <a href="newdict.html#IndexFileSizeReduction">here</a> for more information). This
        behaviour can be switched off by setting
        dictionaryGenerationOmitParFromIndex to false. When
        dictionaryGenerationOmitParFromIndex is set to false, then also the text
        within {{ and }} will be included in the index.<br>
        The property dictionaryGenerationOmitParFromIndex is optional. The
        default value is true.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>languageXIndexNumberOfSourceEntries</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This property is automatically generated by DictionaryGeneration. The
    value contains the number of 'begin of expression'-index entries. This
    value gives the number of words/expressions that the dictionary contains
    for languageX. The values of languageXIndexNumberOfSourceEntries are
    shown in the Info-Dialog (will be implemented in a future version).<br>
        Note that when you merge a dictionary from two (or more) source
    dictionaries and DictionaryGeneration is run once for each of these
    source dictionary, then you need to manually copy the entries for
    languageXIndexNumberOfSourceEntries into the final
    DictionaryForMIDs.properties file.<br>
    &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>logLevel</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: the logLevel is set in the file DictionaryForMIDs.jad (not
    DictionaryForMIDs.properties).<br>
    Allows to switch on some debugging output. A logLevel of 0 switches
    debugging output off, a logLevel of 3 switches all debugging output on,
    and the levels 1 and 2 switch some debugging output on. A higher
    logLevel means more debugging output.<br>
